# Cyrillic Phonetic Keyboard Layout

This repository contains my custom **Cyrillic Phonetic keyboard layout** for Linux, macOS, and Windows.  
The layout mirrors the English keyboard as closely as possible while covering the full Russian alphabet.

Each platform folder includes installation instructions and packaged layout files.
